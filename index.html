<br>
<h5><a name="_a1keqka1uc2d"></a><span lang="EN">By Allison Knox</span></h5>
<h5><a name="_w6xd7b44nah0"></a><b><span lang="EN">Carter Gray Shelter– the
breakout star of local Ridgewood haunt Bar Freda’s Underground Open Mic– is
known for their brooding lyrics over cosmic riffs that pull you in and push you
under all the same. With their hit single “Whirlwind” reverberating in the hearts
and minds of basement show patrons across Ridgewood, Carter has harnessed their
momentum in a quintet of shows, each a metamorphosis of the last. August 3rd at
Caffeine Underground marks their fourth solo main-stage endeavor and second
electric debut– where they managed to make believers out of followers, bringing
us to our knees with bewitching meditations on longing, annihilation, and
deliverance.</span></b></h5>
  <br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Primed by short and sweet opening sets from
bands Dinner Walk and Madonna 5, the audience stirred with anticipation for
Carter’s entrance. And <i>entrance</i> they did: Carter donned a black mini
skirt, KGLW band tee, fishnets, and a black choker to match. Famous for their
pre-show outfit changes, Carter’s personal style corroborates their
heartbreaker vagabond persona.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Imagine your grandfather’s long-neglected
basement, with a 4x6 platform near the back wall. Your forgotten childhood drum
set from Christmas ‘06 still stands, now covered in silver tinsel. Caffeine
Underground’s basement stage necessitates the intimacy of the family home, your
friend’s garage, your mother’s foyer filled with hoarded box sets of <i>Scrubs</i>
DVDs, a torn inflatable pool, and broken down boxes propped up against a dusty
stationery bike. Amid the disarray of Caffeine Underground's basement, a moody
red illuminated our performer’s elven face. Their dark silhouette was
backdropped by two clothespinned 300-threadcount red top sheets. From the
clothesline to the ceiling shimmered a spider web, centered above Carter’s
head: an apt halo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Settled onto the stage, Carter wasted no time
with small talk: they have more effective means of forging their congregation.
Launching into fluttering, ambient chords that garbled into the opening notes
of their top 2 single, “Only Me/Only You,” Carter gave the crowd a brief moment
to brace themselves. As we all lurched inwards, they offered footholds in the
storied promises of a one-sided relationship that teeter-totters between whom
it serves. What looked like swinging as opposed to strumming, Carter wielded their
trusty classic red guitar like a hula hoop. To say they have a mastery of their
instrument would be an understatement. Together, they are weightless— they
glide and cradle and play and swim as one.</span></p>

   <div style="float:left;margin-top:15px;margin-right:15px;padding-bottom=10px;"> <video controls><source src="aspectRationHalfaMind.mp4" type="video/mp4" ></video></div> 

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">“Half a Mind” followed “Only Me/Only You,”
another quintessential demonstration of Carter’s ability to build up walls of
sound, only to drop back into gentle finger picking, or a tingling burst of
silence. Carter has you roaring down the rapids until you’re a drop in the
pond.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">While they’ve got decades of guitar experience
under their belt, their vocal prowess is nothing to scoff at. In a playful and
timely homage to Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” Carter’s powerhouse vocals
dominated. The crowd lit up with recognition as they erupted into the song’s
famous opening lines. Though a few lyrics were omitted, the decrepit-chic
ambience of the basement stage matched their dilettante rendition: with empty
coolers strewn amongst icing-laden cardboard boxes, the venue insists its
performers embody the DIY-playful nature of the space.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">While they wrangled their trusty steed to a
new register, Carter regaled the crowd with tales of their weekend. Not known
for mid-show banter, the audience was delighted to hear Carter was fresh off a
shrooms bender for their favorite band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard’s
two-night run at Forest Hills Stadium. After the requisite thank-yous to the
audience and fellow performers, Carter reestablished momentum with the lulling
and hypnotic “Where.” Carter served sinful licks on the last chorus, with a
notable mute that elicited an exhale from the crowd— permission to come up for
air. Our heads still swimming, they floated us up to the ether with a celestial
outro pumped out from pedals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Their penultimate tune and claim to fame,
“Whirlwind,” is easily the best exhibition of their songwriting prowess.
Finger-picking a tender melody as they sing in hushed tones about a green-eyed
peacekeeping siren they failed to spare from the reach of the whirlwind, Carter
wades the audience in before the uproarious undertow of the chorus. Carter
sonorously pleads: ”Bleed when I bleed/ See what I see/ Need what I need/ Be
where I’ll be,” embodying the truly cloying and puerile ethos of wanting, told
from the isolating and terrifying position it is: “Maybe it’s not real at all.”
While the content of some of their other songs can fall under Things I’ve Heard
Before, “Whirlwind” evades this category by having its hand on the wire of what
it is to want.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Finally out of the whirlwind’s path of
destruction– the audience battered and bruised all the same– Carter took us to
the beach with the finale, “The Flood.” Grappling once again with themes of
fate, disaster, and resurrection, they cemented their catastrophe motif with a
frank and hopeful undercurrent: “There is no mountain we can’t climb/ The only
mountain is you and I.” Indeed, at the end of their tumultuous set, feeling
washed anew in the throes of their tide, it was a relief to see our brooding
performer finally crack a smile in this ultimate anthem.</span></p>
